# DL-ZE-turbulence-model

* Deep learning - RANS CFD framework

Deep learning - RANS CFD framework is an approach to create a coupled framework between a deep learning model trained in python and the OpenFOAM software using the TensorFlow API. Specifically, the implementation shows the creation of a deep learning based zero-equation RANS turbulence model for built environment CFD simulations.

The deep learning model used is a standard multi-layer-perceptron

** Software requirements

- TensorFlow 2.6.2
- Python 3.6.9
- OpenFOAM 9

** Contents

1. ~Tensorflow-model/~ contains the information and code for the training of the deep learning model
2. ~OF-model~ contains the code for the turbulence model



This contains the code to train the deep learning model.
