# DL-ZE-turbulence-model

*Deep learning - CFD coupled framework.*

This shows an approach on how to create a coupled framework between deep learning models and an OpenFOAM simulation using the TensorFlow API. Specifically as an example, the implementation of a deep learning based zero-equation RANS turbulence model for built environment CFD simulations is provided.

The deep learning model used is a standard multi-layer-perceptron

* Software requirements

- TensorFlow 3.idk
- 

* Contents

1. *Tensorflow-model/* folder:

#+begin_src python

print('ciao')
#+end_src

This contains the code to train the deep learning model. 

** DL-ZE model folder

This contains

** Requirements

- Openfoam something
- Tensorflow something else
