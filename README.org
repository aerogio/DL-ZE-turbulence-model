# DL-ZE-turbulence-model

* Deep learning - RANS CFD framework

Deep learning - RANS CFD framework is an approach to create a coupled framework between a deep learning model trained in python and the OpenFOAM software using the TensorFlow API. Specifically, the implementation shows the creation of a deep learning based zero-equation RANS turbulence model for built environment CFD simulations. The deep learning model of choice is a standard Multi-Layer Perceptron

** Software requirements

- TensorFlow 2.6.2
- Python 3.6.9
- OpenFOAM 9
